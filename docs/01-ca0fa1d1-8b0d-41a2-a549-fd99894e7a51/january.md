#### Club Deets
- If you don't use Spotify, please let me know so that I can strategize for future months. :)

- If you're a postcard-receiving member and no longer want to be, send me back an UNSUBSCRIBE postcard (or contact me by the normal means, I guess...).

- LMK if your address changes!

- LMK if you or someone you know would like to be subscribed!
